**Full Stack Open Solutions**

This repository contains my solutions to the exercises from the University of Helsinki's [Full Stack Open](https://fullstackopen.com/en/) course, specifically focusing on [Part 9: First Steps with TypeScript](https://fullstackopen.com/en/part9/first_steps_with_type_script). In this section, I delved into integrating TypeScript with both Express (backend) and React (frontend), enhancing type safety and development efficiency.

**Key Topics Covered:**

- **TypeScript Integration:** Incorporating TypeScript into Express and React applications for improved code quality and maintainability.
- **Tooling and Configuration:** Setting up linters and configuring the development environment to support TypeScript seamlessly.
- **Practical Exercises:** Hands-on tasks that apply TypeScript features to real-world scenarios, reinforcing learning through implementation.

These solutions were developed during my learning journey and may not represent the only or optimal approach to the exercises.
